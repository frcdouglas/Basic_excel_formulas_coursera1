## Sales Performance Analysis

After performing the calculations, we can see that the month with the best sales performance is **December**, with an average sales amount of **R$165,642.90**. On the other hand, **January** has the lowest average, with revenue of **R$46,031.90** during the analyzed years.

Annual growth in sales can also be observed over the past years. The highest increase occurred between **2011 and 2012**, with a growth of **7.59%**. In contrast, the years **2014** (with a decline of **-5.82%**) and **2020** (with **-5.10%**) showed the worst performance during the analyzed period.

When analyzing the monthly averages for **2020**, we observe that sales remained relatively stable throughout the year compared to monthly averages of previous years â€” except for **December**, which recorded the worst historical sales performance.

### Suggestions

- Investigate the factors that contributed to the poor performance in **December 2020**, especially considering that sales in the other months remained stable and, in some cases, even above average.
- Review the campaigns and projects implemented in the years with the best performance (**2012** and **2018**) and consider replicating them in future years.
- Explore strategies to **increase sales in the other months of the year**, as a significant portion of annual revenue is currently concentrated in December alone.
